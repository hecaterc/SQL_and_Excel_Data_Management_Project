**Definitions**

•

**Operational Report** is instrumental to follow-up and report operational **activities on a daily,**

**weekly, biweekly, or monthly basis**. It contains key performance indicators (KPIs) to help monitor

and control business processes.

•

**Executive Report** is a summarized operational report with layers of **aggregated data, and**

**comparisons** between different periods of time. It contains key performance indicators (KPIs) to

facilitate decision-making and performance improvement enhancements.

•

•

Reporting is instrumental to a governed data management framework. A report can be an input to a

specific subdomain or produced by a subdomain as an outcome to support a governance program.

**FINAL PROJECT**

**Applied Data Management Framework: Operational and Executive Reports Development**

•

Each group must develop **two reports**, **an operational report and an executive report** based on a

series of specifications, rules and constraints detailed below.

•

•

Groups must use Exercise 1, 2 and 3 as **building blocks** for the development of this Project.

**Business Assumptions**: reporting always requires a thorough enterprise needs assessment

(business, audience and stakeholders, technology, processes, report objectives).

However, for this Project you do not need to perform an assessment. Instead, you must formulate

**business assumptions** to understand data within a well-defined and clear **context**.

•

The reports should **clearly** and **efficiently** present the right information and facilitate the correct

interpretation of it to the target audience.

**For this Project you must:**

**Apply a Data Governance Framework** to your project**: Using your own words**, elaborate on how

you have applied **theory into practice**.

a. Use the Dama Wheel to identify 3 (three) core Applied Data Governance **sub-domains.**

b. Write 2 (two) Applied Data Governance **principles** for each sub-domain you identified on a.)

c. For each defined sub-domain, write 2 (two) **policies** aligned to your principles, to enforce

oversight of the reporting process. The objective is to achieve a well-controlled, transparent,

efficient, and quality-driven activity.

d. For each defined policy, write 2 (two) **procedures** that you would implement, and under which

you will generate the operational and executive reports **on an ongoing basis**.
